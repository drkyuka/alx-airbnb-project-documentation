# 0. Documenting Project Features and Functionalities

## Objective: Identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project.

### Instructions:

- Review the project requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend here.
- Using `Draw.io`, create a detailed document that lists all the features and functionalities the backend needs to support. This should include user authentication, property management, booking system, and payments.
- Export your design as a PNG file and store it in a directory called `features-and-functionalities/` within your GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
- Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

# 1. Design the Use Case Diagram of the Features and Functionalities

## Objective: Visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.

## Instructions:

- Based on the features outlined in Task 1, use `Draw.io` to create a use case diagram that visualizes the interactions between users and the system for key functionalities like user registration, property booking, and payments.
- Ensure that all key actors and interactions are captured in the diagram.
- Export your diagram as a PNG file and store it in a directory called `use-case-diagram/` within your GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
- Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

# 2. Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories

## Objective: Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

## Instructions:

- Using the use case diagram from Task 1, convert each use case into a relevant user story. Example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”
- Write at least 5 user stories that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.
- Create a file named `user-stories.md` in the directory `user-stories/` within your GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` and document your user stories there.
- Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository

# 3. Design a Data Flow Diagram for Your Features and Functionalities

## Objective: Create a data flow diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

## Instructions:

- Based on the features and functionalities identified in Task 1, design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using `Draw.io` that illustrates how data moves through the system. Include key entities like users, properties, bookings, and payments.
- The DFD should cover data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations.
- Export your diagram as a PNG file as `data-flow.png` and store it in a directory called `data-flow-diagram/` within your GitHub repository `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
- Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

# 4. Design a Flowchart for System Processes

## Objective: Map the workflow and processes of the backend features.

## Instructions:

- Choose one of the key backend processes (e.g., user registration, property booking) and design a flowchart in `Draw.io` to visualize the steps and data flow for this process.
- Export the flowchart as a `PNG` and store it in the flowcharts directory under the `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` GitHub repository.
- Commit and push the changes to your repository.

# 5. Write Requirement Specifications for Backend Features

## Objective: Document the technical and functional requirements for each feature.

## Instructions:

- Write detailed requirement specifications for at least three key backend features from Task 1 (e.g., User Authentication, Property Management, Booking System).
- Include API endpoints, input/output specifications, validation rules, and performance criteria.
- Document this in a `requirements.md` file and store it in the root directory of the `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` GitHub repository.
- Commit and push the changes to your repository.
